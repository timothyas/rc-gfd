\section{Gulf of Mexico Dataset and ESN Prediction}
\label{sec:gom}

The Gulf of Mexico reanalysis dataset used to generate the prediction in
\cref{fig:gom_sst} was provided by \citet{gom_dataset}.
The data consists of 6~hourly snapshots of 2D sea surface height and 3D
temperature, salinity, and zonal and meridional velocities,
covering 1993-2012 (inclusive).
We used only the top level of temperature, and used the first 18~years as
training, and the last two years as test data.
