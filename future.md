# RC For GFD Emulation

## Future

- Talk about why dask (cloud, laptop, hpc), optimization (from data to good
  model asap),
- Someone to talk to relating to theoretical CFL condition & emulation
    - Eric Bollt, Cecile Penland, Ian Grooms


## Other results

If deemed interesting, these could be added too

- RK4 "version" of RC shows essentially same behavior as RC... no improvement in
  subsampling
- Macro parameters do not transfer... basically these are tightly linked to the
  subsampling (and possibly dynamics)
