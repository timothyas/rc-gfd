\title{Recurrent Neural Network Emulation of Turbulent Geophysical Fluids}
% Considered "high resolution GFD", but SQG is not necessarily high resolution, just well-resolved turbulence.
% This is clearly TBD...

\section{Open Research}
AGU requires an Availability Statement for the underlying data needed to understand, evaluate, and build upon the reported research at the time of peer review and publication.

Authors should include an Availability Statement for the software that has a significant impact on the research. Details and templates are in the Availability Statement section of the Data and Software for Authors Guidance: \url{https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-and-Software-for-Authors#availability}

It is important to cite individual datasets in this section and, and they must be included in your bibliography. Please use the type field in your bibtex file to specify the type of data cited. Some options include Dataset, Software, Collection, ComputationalNotebook. Ex:
