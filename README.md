# RC For GFD Emulation

## Last minute writing stuff

Other logistics
- minimize notebook sizes ... things that will go to overleaf etc...
- move auxiliary stuff to trash repo


## After sending off the draft

- textsize in figures
- update RC fig to have T anom?
- re-optimize the Gulf case
- Play with the linear case...


## Other potentially interesting topics, for this paper?

- RK4 "version" of RC shows essentially same behavior as RC... no improvement in
  subsampling
- Macro parameters do not transfer... basically these are tightly linked to the
  subsampling
