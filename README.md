# RC For GFD Emulation

## Final Pass

- Add a/b/c labels to figure panels (and reference in text)

## Other results

If deemed interesting, these could be added too

- RK4 "version" of RC shows essentially same behavior as RC... no improvement in
  subsampling
- Macro parameters do not transfer... basically these are tightly linked to the
  subsampling
