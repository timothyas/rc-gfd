# RC For GFD Emulation

## Final Pass

- Update figures: swap the figure size back to how it was, add single bottom
  legend for all panels
- Also... could show 99% confidence interval for persistence for all...
- Add more description in the figure captions to guide the reader
  (especially the qualitative... maybe even a box to highlight features)
- Remove any a/b/c labels from figures
- Talk about persistent forecast in text, final paragraph of 5.1
- TC Comment on penalizing what we want...  internal architecture updates
- Conclusions

## Future

- Talk about why dask (cloud, laptop, hpc), optimization (from data to good
  model asap),
- Someone to talk to relating to theoretical CFL condition & emulation
    - Eric Bollt, Cecile Penland, Ian Grooms


## Other results

If deemed interesting, these could be added too

- RK4 "version" of RC shows essentially same behavior as RC... no improvement in
  subsampling
- Macro parameters do not transfer... basically these are tightly linked to the
  subsampling
