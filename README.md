# RC For GFD Emulation

## Reading list


### General background
- Nonnenmacher & Greenberg, (2021). Deep Emulators for Differentiation, Forecasting, and Parametrization in Earth Science Simulators.
    - What architecture(s)? Seems like they learn LEs - is that true?
- Weyn et al (2019, 2020, and 2021).
    - Why don't they use the ConvLSTM? Why CNN? Good to know these...


### Multi scale

- Na et al (2021). Hierarchical delay-memory ESN.
    - Do they really get multiscale performance?
- Moon et al (2021). Hierarchical architectures in RC
    - multiscale?
- Faranda et al (2021). Enhancing geophysical flow machine learning performance
  via scale separation.
    - Multi scale...

### Other RC
- Verstraeten et al, (2007). An experimental unification of RC
    - This will finally help clarify RC terminology (ESN, LSM, RC, etc..) ... I
      hope
    - LE as a validation metric... what did we do that's new again?
