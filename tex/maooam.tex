\section{Coarse Resolution, Quasi-Geostrophic Model}
\label{sec:maooam}

Purpose: illustrate that the RNN works very well for a large scale, coarse
resolution system

Why is this necessary on top of Arcomano et al?
\begin{itemize}
    \item optimization of hyperparameters
    \item bias term (Platt et al ..)
    \item (potential tangent here) fourier space
\end{itemize}
